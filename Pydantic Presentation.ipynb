These algorithms are all data based on your viewing/listening history and often times leads us to finding some of our new favorites. Interested in figuring out how to do some of that yourself? Let's find out!\n",

    "### Problem: Parsing JSON Data Files\n",
    "Data comes in all shapes and sizes but is more often than not messy and ugly. While Pandas has become an extremely popular package for manipulating data, it's extremely intensive and difficult to use on non-flat file formats. Another prominent file format is JSON. JSON is simple and understandable, but is often tedious and confusing to parse and analyze.\n",
    "\n",
    "As I'm sure you know, data management sucks up a majority of the time for any project. You have to get the data, format it, validate it, write additional functions and that's all before just performing analysis. Additionally, if you're part of a larger development project, it's easy for the code to diverge between you and other developers. But what if there was an easier way to get past that stage and get on to the analytics? What if writing the code was understandable to look back on and easy to manage?\n",
    "\n",
    "For loops and various comprehensions can be used to parse the data, but they often results in ugly code that is difficult to maintain and pass on. In a professional environment, it's critical to maintain efficient and effective code and the delays in understanding and maintaining JSON data can result in all types of problems. This is where Pydantic Comes in...."

    "### What is Pydantic?\n",
    "Pydantic is a data validation and settings management package in Python that allows you to specify and validate the format of the data. Pydantic's Basemodel module utilizes DataClasses which allows you to create a class of what our data should look like so we can declare which fields are required and what types they should take, what errors should be raised, as well as declaring defaults and much more! \n",
    "\n",
    "Pydantic has a lot of great capabilities but we'll focus on the Data Validation and Structure part here."

  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### Why Pydantic?\n",
    "1. **Data Validation**\n",
    "\n",
    "      Reading through the entire JSON to look for outliers and anomalies can be impossible, Pydantic allows us to specify a structure and if the JSON doesn't follow it, we'll know.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "2. **Readability**\n",
    "\n",
    "      Pydantic models are clean and easy to read. All in the matter of 4 easy classes, we can easily understand the structure and fields of the entire JSON document. Pydantic makes it simple and efficient to locate and utilize any field, dictionary or list we would need. It's also especially good at making complicated, nested JSON files simple and readable.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "3. **Maintenance**\n",
    "\n",
    "      One of the best parts of Pydantic is that anyone can pick up your code, quickly understand the structure of the file you're reading and figure out where and how to update/fix/change any code. Additionally, if you add methods and functions (like we will below) to any of your classes, you no longer have to sort through what each function is doing to access one exact element of the JSON. Instead, we know exactly where it is, what it's doing, and how to adjust it.\n",
    "      \n",
    "##### Additionally, \n",
    "     \n",
    "4. **Plays nicely with your IDE/linter/brain**\n",
    "\n",
    "    There's no new schema definition micro-language to learn. If you know how to use python type hints, you know how to use pydantic. Data structures are just instances of classes you define with type annotations, so auto-completion, linting, mypy, IDEs (especially PyCharm), and your intuition should all work properly with your validated data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Dual Use**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Pydantic's BaseSettings class allows pydantic to be used in both a \"validate this request data\" context and in a \"load my system settings\" context. The main differences are that system settings can be read from environment variables, and more complex objects like DSNs and python objects are often required.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Fast**\n",
    "\n",
    "    In benchmarks pydantic is faster than all other tested libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Extensible**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Pydantic allows custom data types to be defined or you can extend validation with methods on a model decorated with the validator decorator.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Dataclasses integration**\n",
    "\n",
    "    As well as BaseModel, pydantic provides a dataclass decorator which creates (almost) vanilla python dataclasses with input data parsing and validation.\n",
